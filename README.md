### IDEA OF GAME
In this game you have 2 sort matryoshkas(blue and black). First these matryoshkas for each player are 3 sort ( big, middle and small). Also in game you have 3 x 3 board. You can add your matryoshkas to this board. But in board you can add just that:

1.You can add just this order small, middle next big. 

2.Each matryoshkas can use just 2 times. If you use first then matryoshka cut to place and hand seen in screen. If you use last (second) time then matryoshka delete in the screen.
